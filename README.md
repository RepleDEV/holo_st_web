# Holo ST Website Source

[Express](https://www.expressjs.com) based website used for tracking [Hololive](https://www.hololive.tv) stream schedules  
using a modified version of the [Holo ST Module/CLI](https://www.github.com/repledev/holo_st).

Yes, indeed, there is already an [official website](www.schedule.hololive.tv) made to do the same thing, this one fixes most of its accuracy issues by using a combination of web-scraping using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), and the [Youtube V3 API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to track youtube streams.

This project also provides other additional features like search and filter, among others.

## Project Status

Current status: **Unfinished: Hosted**.

The project is now hosted [here](https://holo-st-dev.herokuapp.com) as the website at it's current state is already enough to be used!  
The website is prevented from idling with [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com), the 6 hour break will start at 00:00 JST (15:00 GMT).  
The project is being hosted so that I could test its long-term reliability.  
There is still much to add, I'll add a road map sometime.  
The website won't be updated unless it's a feature update or it's a security/performance update.

Current website build is in [this branch](https://github.com/RepleDEV/holo_st_web/tree/prod-deploy).

This project is being developed by me, and me only, development will be slow.
