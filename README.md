# Holo ST Website Source

[Express](https://www.expressjs.com) based website used for tracking [Hololive](https://www.hololive.tv) stream schedules  
using a modified version of the [Holo ST Module/CLI](https://www.github.com/repledev/holo_st).

Yes, indeed, there is already an [official website](www.schedule.hololive.tv) made to do the same thing, this one fixes most of its accuracy issues by using a combination of web-scraping using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), and the [Youtube V3 API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to track youtube streams.

This project also provides other additional features like search and filter, among others.

Yes, this project is planned to be hosted. (On [Heroku](www.heroku.com). Sorry)
